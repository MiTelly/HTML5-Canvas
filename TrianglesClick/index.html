    <p>In the canvas below when you click the first time on the canvas a line
        will appear starting in the canvas center and ending where you clicked.
        Click again and a second line will appear with an automatic third line returning
        drawn to the center and forming a triangle. If you keep clicking you'll keep making
        triangles!!!
