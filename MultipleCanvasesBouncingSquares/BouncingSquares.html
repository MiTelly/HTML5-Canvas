      The first objective in this section is to get 4 boxes to move right on an HTML5 canvas.
      The second objective is to get them to bounce continuously off of the canvas walls.

    <div id="center">
      <canvas id="canvas1" width="960" height="500">
    </div>

    <p>
      To begin. Let's get 4 boxes on a canvas. We'll make them move a little later.
      <br><br>
      The code to get the boxes on a canvas is as follows. This is a slightly different
      way of doing it. We used an array of boxes and .forEach to cycle through them.
    </p>

    <div id="center2">
      <canvas id="canvas2" width="960" height="500">
    </div>

    <p>
      Now let's bounce the lime box horizontally off of the canvas walls.
    </p>

    <div id="center3">
      <canvas id="canvas3" width="960" height="500">
    </div>

    <p>
      And let's bounce four boxes back and forth. Nice. You'll notice the orange box
      always moves over the blue box - this is because the orange one is always drawn
      second. We could do all sorts of things with them from this point.
    </p>

    <div id="center4">
      <canvas id="canvas4" width="960" height="500">
    </div>

    <p>
      Let's move them all diagonally at 45 degree angles and bounce them off of
      canvas walls. No collision and deflection.
    </p>

    <div id="center5">
      <canvas id="canvas5" width="960" height="500">
    </div>
